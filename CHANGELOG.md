# 3.2.0

This minor release introduces new features for presentation, view snapshotting, and defered transition work. There is also a new photo album example demonstrating how to build a contextual transition in which the context may change.

## New features

Transition context now has a `deferToCompletion:` API for deferring work to the completion of the transition.

```swift
// Example (Swift):
foreImageView.isHidden = true
context.defer {
  foreImageView.isHidden = false
}
```

`MDMTransitionPresentationController` is a presentation controller that supports presenting view controllers at custom frames and showing an overlay scrim view.

The new `MDMTransitionViewSnapshotter` class can be used to create and manage snapshot views during a transition.

```swift
let snapshotter = TransitionViewSnapshotter(containerView: context.containerView)
context.defer {
  snapshotter.removeAllSnapshots()
}

let snapshotView = snapshotter.snapshot(of: view, isAppearing: context.direction == .forward)
```
